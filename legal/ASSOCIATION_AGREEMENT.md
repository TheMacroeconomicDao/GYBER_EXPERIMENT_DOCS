---

## 3. MEMBERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE TOKEN

### 3.1 Membership Qualification
Membership in the Association is open to all holders of the **GBR Governance Token** (as defined below). There are no other qualifications, dues, or fees required for membership.

### 3.2 GBR Governance Token

**Token Name:** GBR  
**Standard:** BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain)  
**Contract Address:** `0xa970cae9fa1d7cca913b7c19df45bf33d55384a9`  
**Blockchain:** BNB Smart Chain (BSC)

The GBR token serves as the exclusive mechanism for governance participation. Each token represents one unit of voting power in on-chain governance.

**Fixed Supply Guarantee:**
The total supply of GBR tokens is permanently fixed at the amount minted at token creation. The GBR token smart contract does **not** contain a `mint()` function and **no new GBR tokens can ever be created**. This is an immutable property of the token contract and cannot be changed by governance vote, smart contract upgrade, or any other mechanism. The only direction of supply change is deflationary (via buyback & burn as described in Section 9.5). Any proposal to deploy a new token with minting capability would require dissolution of the current governance structure and is explicitly prohibited under this Agreement.

### 3.3 Token Distribution
The total supply of GBR tokens is distributed as follows:

- **Governance Pool (≥80%)**: Distributed among members of the Gybernaty Community across multiple wallets (approximately 10-50 wallets) for on-chain voting purposes. This ensures decentralization while maintaining operational efficiency.
  
- **Trading Float (≤20%)**: Available for liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges (PancakeSwap) to establish market price discovery and enable community participation.

### 3.4 Rights of Token Holders
Holders of GBR tokens have the following rights:

- **Voting Rights**: Participate in all on-chain governance votes proportional to token holdings
- **Proposal Rights**: Submit governance proposals if holding the minimum threshold (as defined in Section 5.7)
- **Treasury Oversight**: Monitor and approve all treasury operations
- **Information Rights**: Access to all on-chain transaction data and governance records

### 3.5 No Profit Distribution
GBR tokens do **not** entitle holders to:

- Dividends or profit distributions
- Ownership of Association assets
- Guarantees of token value appreciation

The Association explicitly disclaims any profit-sharing or security-like characteristics of the GBR token. The token is a **utility token** used solely for governance purposes.

### 3.6 Transferability
GBR tokens are freely transferable on decentralized exchanges and between wallets, subject to applicable laws and regulations. The Association does not impose lock-up periods or transfer restrictions, except as may be required by law.

---

## 4. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

### 4.1 On-Chain Governance as Supreme Authority
The Association is governed **exclusively** by on-chain votes of GBR token holders through smart contracts deployed on BNB Smart Chain. All governance decisions are executed automatically via code, without discretionary intervention by any individual or entity.

### 4.2 No Traditional Board of Directors
The Association does **not** have a traditional board of directors, officers, or managing members with discretionary authority over Association affairs. All decisions are made by token holder vote.

### 4.3 Organizer
The **Organizer** is a nominal party responsible solely for filing the Articles of Organization with the Wyoming Secretary of State. After formation, the Organizer has no authority, rights, or obligations with respect to the Association.

### 4.4 Administrator (Ministerial Agent)
The **Administrator** (also referred to as the "Ministerial Agent" or "Director") is an external service provider engaged by the Association to perform ministerial and administrative functions as directed by on-chain governance. The Administrator has **zero discretionary authority**.

**Responsibilities:**
- Open and maintain fiat bank accounts in the name of the Association
- Execute fiat payments approved by on-chain vote (legal fees, tax payments, service providers)
- File tax returns (Form 8832, Form 990-N or 990, Form 1099 for grant recipients)
- Conduct KYC/AML compliance for fiat recipients as required by law
- Receive official government notices and legal service of process
- Maintain corporate records and bookkeeping
- Report to token holders on all actions taken

**Limitations:**
- May **not** initiate any expenditure without prior on-chain approval
- Has **no access** to crypto treasury (keys held by smart contracts)
- May **not** block or delay execution of approved governance decisions
- Subject to immediate termination and replacement by governance vote

The Administrator shall be compensated at a rate approved by on-chain governance vote and shall enter into a written **Ministerial Agent Agreement** defining duties, limitations, and penalties for non-compliance.

### 4.5 Emergency Multisig (Optional)
The Association may, by governance vote, establish an emergency multisig wallet for:

- Pausing smart contracts in case of critical security vulnerabilities
- Executing time-sensitive operations when on-chain voting is impractical due to imminent threat

**Restrictions:**
- Multisig signers appointed by governance vote
- Limited authority defined in smart contract code
- Subject to on-chain veto within [24-48 hours] of action
- All actions logged on-chain and reported to community

---

## 5. ON-CHAIN GOVERNANCE MECHANISM

### 5.1 Governor Smart Contract
All governance is conducted through the **Governor Contract**, an OpenZeppelin-based smart contract deployed on BNB Smart Chain, implementing the Governor Bravo / OpenZeppelin Governor standard.

**Contract Address:** [TO BE DEPLOYED]

### 5.2 Timelock Contract
All approved proposals are queued in a **Timelock Contract** for a mandatory delay period before execution. This provides the community with time to review and, if necessary, veto malicious or erroneous proposals.

**Contract Address:** [TO BE DEPLOYED]  
**Timelock Delay:** [24-48 hours] (to be determined by initial governance vote)

### 5.3 Voting Process

**Step 1: Proposal Submission**
- Any token holder meeting the **Proposal Threshold** may submit a governance proposal
- Proposal must include: (1) Description, (2) Executable code (if on-chain action), (3) Voting period

**Step 2: Voting Delay**
- After submission, there is a **Voting Delay** period (e.g., 1-2 days) before voting begins
- Allows community time to review and discuss proposal

**Step 3: Voting Period**
- Token holders cast votes: **For**, **Against**, or **Abstain**
- Voting power is proportional to GBR tokens held at the start of the proposal (snapshot block)
- Votes are cast by calling `castVote()` function on Governor contract (cost ~$0.01-0.03 per vote on BSC)

**Step 4: Quorum and Approval**
- Proposal passes if:
  - **Quorum** met (minimum % of tokens voted)
  - **Majority** of votes are **For**
- Proposal fails if quorum not met or majority votes **Against**

**Step 5: Timelock Queue**
- Approved proposals are automatically queued in Timelock contract
- Community has [24-48 hours] to review before execution

**Step 6: Execution**
- After Timelock delay, proposal is executed automatically on-chain
- If proposal involves fiat operations, Administrator receives on-chain instruction and must execute within [7 days]

### 5.4 Governance Parameters (Initial Values)

| Parameter | Value | Modifiable by Governance |
|-----------|-------|--------------------------|
| **Voting Delay** | 1-2 days | Yes |
| **Voting Period** | 3-7 days | Yes |
| **Quorum** | 10-20% of total supply | Yes |
| **Proposal Threshold** | 0.5-1% of total supply | Yes |
| **Timelock Delay** | 24-48 hours | Yes |

These parameters may be adjusted by governance vote as the Association evolves.

### 5.5 Proposal Types

**Routine Proposals** (e.g., grants <$10,000, operational expenses):
- Standard parameters (quorum, delay, period as above)

**Critical Proposals** (e.g., Administrator removal, Governor contract upgrade, expenditures >$50,000):
- **Higher Quorum**: [30-40%] (to be determined)
- **Longer Voting Period**: [7-14 days]
- **Longer Timelock**: [48-72 hours]

### 5.6 Proposal Execution

**On-Chain Actions:**
- Automatically executed by Governor + Timelock contracts (e.g., transfer crypto from treasury, mint/burn tokens, upgrade contracts)

**Off-Chain / Fiat Actions:**
- Governor contract emits event log with instructions for Administrator
- Administrator must execute within [7 days] or face penalties
- Administrator reports completion on-chain or via designated communication channel

### 5.7 Proposal Threshold
To prevent spam, only token holders with at least **[0.5-1%]** of total GBR supply may submit proposals. This threshold may be adjusted by governance vote.

### 5.8 Delegation
GBR token holders may delegate their voting power to another address using the `delegate()` function. Delegation does not transfer token ownership, only voting rights.

### 6.4 Administrator Transition and DAO-Appointed Executors

**Principle of Uninterrupted Governance:**
The Association's operations shall **never** depend on the presence of an Administrator. The DAO retains full operational capability at all times through the following mechanisms:

**DAO-Appointed Trusted Executors:**
At any time, with or without an active Administrator, token holders may nominate and approve via governance vote one or more **Trusted Executors** — individuals or specialized companies — to perform specific operational tasks on behalf of the Association.

**Scope of Trusted Executors:**
- Execute specific fiat payments or banking operations
- Handle legal, accounting, or compliance tasks
- Manage vendor relationships or service contracts
- Perform any ministerial function normally assigned to the Administrator
- Scope is strictly limited to the specific mandate approved by governance vote

**Appointment Process:**
1. Any token holder meeting the Proposal Threshold may nominate an Executor for a specific task or role
2. Governance vote approves or rejects (standard parameters)
3. Executor receives on-chain mandate with defined scope, budget, and duration
4. Executor reports completion on-chain or via designated communication channel

**Administrator Vacancy Transition:**
In the event the Administrator role is vacant (due to termination, resignation, or any other reason):
- All crypto operations continue uninterrupted (governed by smart contracts)
- Governance immediately appoints one or more Trusted Executors to cover critical fiat and compliance functions
- Executors operate under the same restrictions as the Administrator (zero discretion, execute only governance-approved actions)
- Governance initiates search for a permanent replacement Administrator (if deemed necessary)
- There is no mandatory requirement to appoint a permanent Administrator — the community may operate indefinitely through DAO-appointed Executors if governance so decides

**Limitations on Trusted Executors:**
- Subject to all restrictions applicable to the Administrator (Section 6.5)
- Authority expires automatically upon completion of mandate or at the end of the approved term
- No Executor may serve for more than [6 months] without governance re-approval
- Subject to immediate removal by governance vote

### 6.5 Limitation on Administrator Authority

The Administrator is **strictly prohibited** from:

- Initiating any expenditure without on-chain approval
- Accessing, controlling, or moving crypto assets (keys held by smart contracts only)
- Making discretionary decisions on behalf of the Association
- Entering into contracts exceeding $2,000 without governance approval
- Hiring employees or contractors without governance approval
- Speaking publicly on behalf of the Association without governance authorization

**Consequences of Violation:**
- Written notice specifying the alleged violation
- **Cure Period:** 7 calendar days to remedy the violation (except for fraud or criminal conduct, which warrant immediate termination)
- If not cured: Termination by governance vote
- Contractual liquidated damages: **$[10,000-50,000]**
- Legal action to recover damages

**Administrator Legal Protection:**
The Administrator shall NOT be penalized for refusing to execute a governance-approved action if:
- The action would violate applicable law (e.g., OFAC sanctions, AML regulations, tax fraud)
- The Administrator provides written justification citing the specific legal concern within 48 hours
- The Association may seek independent legal opinion to resolve the dispute
- If independent counsel confirms the action is lawful, Administrator must execute within 7 days or face termination

---

## 7. TREASURY MANAGEMENT

### 7.1 Crypto Treasury

**Structure:**
All crypto assets (GBR tokens, BNB, stablecoins, other tokens) are held in the **Timelock Contract** controlled by the Governor Contract.

**Asset Types:**
- GBR governance tokens (for buyback & burn, liquidity provision)
- BNB (for gas fees, liquidity pairs)
- Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD) for operational reserves
- Other tokens received as donations, grants, or revenue

**Access Control:**
- **Only** the Governor contract (via approved proposals) can move funds from the Timelock
- No individual holds private keys to the treasury
- Emergency multisig (if established) may pause contracts but cannot withdraw funds

**Transaction Types:**
- Grants to community members or projects
- Payment for services (paid in crypto)
- Liquidity provision to DEX
- Buyback & burn of GBR tokens
- Conversion to fiat (transferred to Administrator's bank account)

**Approval Process:**
1. Governance proposal submitted (e.g., "Grant $10,000 USDT to Alice for AI research")
2. Vote conducted
3. If approved, transaction queued in Timelock
4. After delay, transaction executed automatically

### 7.2 Fiat Treasury — Two-Tier Banking System

The Association employs a **two-tier fiat banking structure** to maximize DAO control while enabling operational flexibility:

**Tier 1: Treasury Fiat Account (DAO-Controlled, Programmable)**

**Structure:**
- **Provider:** Bridge (https://bridge.xyz) or Circle Business Account
- **Account Type:** Business Account with API access
- **Control:** Programmatically controlled via smart contracts using Chainlink Functions Oracle
- **Access:** No individual has direct access; all operations executed via on-chain governance votes

**Purpose:**
- Primary fiat treasury for the Association
- Large payments (>$5,000)
- Transfers to Operating Account (Tier 2)
- Long-term fiat reserves

**Operations:**
- **Crypto-to-Fiat Conversion:** Receives USDT/USDC from Timelock → automatic conversion to USD via Bridge/Circle API
- **Wire Transfers:** Executes wire transfers to third parties (e.g., legal firms, service providers) based on governance-approved proposals
- **Operating Account Funding:** Automated monthly transfers to Operating Account (e.g., $10,000/month budget)
- **Reporting:** All transactions logged on-chain via Oracle and published on governance dashboard

**Funding:**
- Crypto-to-fiat conversion (approved by governance vote)
- Fiat donations (if received)
- Revenue from fiat-based services (if any)

**Security:**
- API credentials stored in **Threshold Network** (decentralized secret management)
- Smart contracts use threshold signatures to access API (no single point of failure)
- Multi-layer authorization (governance vote → Timelock delay → Oracle execution)

**Tier 2: Operating Fiat Account (Administrator-Managed, Operational)**

**Structure:**
- **Provider:** Traditional U.S. bank (Mercury, Relay, Lead Bank, or Wyoming local bank)
- **Account Type:** Business checking account
- **Control:** Administrator as sole signatory
- **Access:** Administrator can make payments within approved budget limits

**Purpose:**
- Operational expenses and routine payments (<$5,000)
- Day-to-day cash management
- Emergency expenses (within limits)

**Operations:**
- **Routine Expenditures:**
  - Cloud hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) — if not paid in crypto
  - SaaS subscriptions
  - Office supplies and miscellaneous expenses
  - Legal and accounting fees (small invoices)
  - Government fees and taxes
  - Administrator compensation

- **Budget Limits:**
  - **Maximum Balance:** $20,000 (excess returned to Treasury Fiat Account via wire transfer)
  - **Maximum Single Payment Without Additional Approval:** $2,000
  - **Monthly Budget:** Determined by governance vote (e.g., $10,000/month)

**Funding:**
- Monthly transfer from Treasury Fiat Account (Tier 1) via governance-approved automated schedule
- Example: Governance votes "Transfer $10,000/month from Treasury to Operating Account"

**Accountability:**
- **Monthly Reporting:** Administrator provides itemized report of all Operating Account expenditures
- **Bank Statements:** Published to governance forum (or summarized if containing sensitive payee information)
- **Audit Rights:** Governance may request detailed audit of Operating Account at any time

**Replenishment Process:**
1. Beginning of month: Automated transfer from Treasury Fiat Account to Operating Account ($X,000 as approved by governance)
2. Administrator uses Operating Account for routine expenses
3. End of month: Administrator reports all expenditures
4. If balance exceeds $20,000: Administrator wires excess back to Treasury Fiat Account
5. If balance insufficient: Administrator may request supplemental transfer via governance vote

**Division of Responsibilities:**

| Account Type | Controller | Approval Required | Use Cases |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Treasury Fiat (Tier 1)** | DAO (via API + Chainlink) | Governance vote for every transaction | Large payments (>$5k), strategic reserves, Operating Account funding |
| **Operating Fiat (Tier 2)** | Administrator | Pre-approved budget (monthly governance vote) | Routine expenses (<$2k), operational flexibility |

**Example Workflow:**

**Large Payment (e.g., $15,000 legal fee):**
1. Governance proposal: "Wire $15,000 from Treasury Fiat Account to XYZ Law Firm"
2. Vote passes
3. Timelock → Chainlink Oracle → Bridge API → Wire transfer executed
4. Transaction hash recorded on-chain

**Small Payment (e.g., $500 AWS bill):**
1. Administrator pays from Operating Account (within monthly budget)
2. Logged in monthly expense report
3. No governance vote required (pre-approved via monthly budget allocation)

### 7.3 Crypto-to-Fiat Conversion — Phased Automation Plan

The Association implements a **three-phase strategy** to progressively automate fiat operations while minimizing human intermediaries:

**Phase 1: Manual Conversion (Launch to 6-12 Months)**

**Timeline:** Immediately upon DUNA formation through first 6-12 months of operation

**Strategy:**
- **Crypto-first approach:** Maximize payments in crypto (USDT, USDC, BNB) where accepted
- **Crypto payment processors:** Use BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, or Binance Pay for vendors accepting crypto
- **Minimal fiat conversion:** Only convert when absolutely necessary (e.g., government fees, traditional vendors)

**Conversion Method:**
- **On-Ramp Service:** MoonPay or Banxa for small amounts (<$5,000)
- **Manual CEX:** Administrator or designated community member manually converts via Binance/Coinbase for larger amounts

**Process:**
1. Governance votes: "Convert 5,000 USDT to USD for [specific purpose]"
2. Timelock sends USDT to designated address (MoonPay or individual's CEX account)
3. Conversion executed manually
4. USD wired to Operating Account
5. Confirmation reported to governance

**Infrastructure:**
- **Single Bank Account:** Operating Account (Tier 2) only
- **No automation:** All conversions manual

**Expected Volume:** <$5,000/month in fiat operations

---

**Phase 2: Semi-Automated Treasury (6-12 Months, Treasury >$100k)**

**Timeline:** After treasury exceeds $100,000 and community votes to proceed

**Strategy:**
- Open **Treasury Fiat Account (Tier 1)** with Bridge or Circle
- Develop **Automation Contract** for programmatic fiat operations
- Establish two-tier banking system

**Technical Implementation:**
1. **Open Bridge Business Account:**
   - Complete KYC/onboarding (EIN, Articles of Organization, BOI Report)
   - Obtain API credentials with permissions: receive crypto, convert to USD, wire transfers
   - Set up FDIC-insured USD account

2. **Deploy Automation Infrastructure:**
   - **Automation Smart Contract** on BSC (custom development)
   - **Chainlink Functions** integration for Oracle calls to Bridge API
   - **Threshold Network** integration for secure API key storage
   - Cost: ~$10,000-20,000 (approved by governance vote)

3. **Automate Key Workflows:**
   - **Crypto→Fiat:** Governance vote → Timelock sends USDT to Bridge → auto-conversion → USD in Treasury Account
   - **Large Payments:** Governance vote → Chainlink Oracle calls Bridge API → wire transfer executed
   - **Operating Account Funding:** Monthly automated transfer (e.g., $10k/month)

**Process Example (Automated Large Payment):**
```
1. Governance votes: "Wire $15,000 to ABC Law Firm from Treasury Account"
2. Vote passes → queued in Timelock (48-hour delay)
3. Timelock executes → calls Automation Contract
4. Automation Contract → Chainlink Functions → Bridge API
5. Bridge API: Debit $15,000 from Treasury Account → Wire to ABC Law Firm
6. Oracle records transaction hash on-chain
7. Governance dashboard shows: "Payment Complete: [TX Hash]"
```

**Infrastructure:**
- **Two Bank Accounts:** Treasury Account (Tier 1, API-controlled) + Operating Account (Tier 2, Administrator-managed)
- **Partial Automation:** Large payments automated; routine expenses still manual via Operating Account

**Expected Volume:** $10,000-50,000/month in fiat operations

---

**Phase 3: Full Automation (12+ Months)**

**Timeline:** After 12+ months of successful Phase 2 operation

**Strategy:**
- **90%+ automation:** Nearly all fiat operations without human intervention
- **Minimal Administrator role:** Only for compliance, tax filings, and emergency situations

**Automated Workflows:**
1. **Recurring Bills:** Smart contract schedules monthly payments (e.g., AWS $2,000/month) → auto-execution via Bridge API
2. **Grant Distributions:** Governance-approved grants paid automatically (wire or ACH)
3. **Operating Account Replenishment:** Fully automated monthly transfers based on pre-approved budget
4. **Tax Payments:** Pre-scheduled payments to IRS/state agencies via API

**Process Example (Fully Automated Recurring Payment):**
```
1. One-time governance vote: "Authorize recurring payment: $2,000/month to AWS via Treasury Account"
2. Automation Contract stores schedule on-chain
3. Each month (automated):
   - Smart contract checks: Time for AWS payment?
   - Yes → Chainlink Oracle → Bridge API → ACH payment to AWS
   - Receipt recorded on-chain
4. Administrator reviews monthly (passive oversight only)
```

**Administrator Role (Reduced):**
- **Operating Account Management:** Handle <$2,000 expenses that don't fit automated categories
- **Tax Filings:** Prepare and file IRS forms (cannot be fully automated due to legal requirements)
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Review AML alerts, respond to bank inquiries
- **Emergency Overrides:** Handle unforeseen situations requiring immediate action

**Infrastructure:**
- **Fully Automated Treasury Account** with scheduled payments, automated conversions, API-driven operations
- **Minimal Operating Account** for edge cases only

**Expected Volume:** $50,000+/month, 90%+ automated

---

**Security Architecture (All Phases):**

**API Key Management:**
- Bridge/Circle API keys stored in **Threshold Network** (decentralized threshold cryptography)
- No single entity holds complete key
- Smart contract assembles threshold signature to access API
- Keys rotated every 90 days via governance vote

**Authorization Layers:**
1. **Governance Vote:** Community approves every transaction (automated or manual)
2. **Timelock Delay:** 24-48 hour delay for review and veto opportunity
3. **Oracle Verification:** Chainlink Functions verifies API response before recording on-chain
4. **Audit Trail:** Every operation logged immutably on-chain

**Failsafe Mechanisms:**
- **Circuit Breaker:** If >$50,000 attempted in single transaction → automatic pause, requires Emergency Multisig approval
- **Rate Limiting:** Max $X per day/week from Treasury Account (set by governance)
- **Manual Override:** Governance can disable automation and revert to manual mode at any time

---

**Governance Activation:**

Each phase requires **explicit governance vote** to proceed:
- **Phase 1:** Approved by default at launch
- **Phase 2:** Requires governance vote to allocate $10k-20k for development and approve Bridge account opening
- **Phase 3:** Requires governance vote to enable full automation features

**Rollback Plan:**
If automation fails or is compromised:
1. Emergency Multisig pauses Automation Contract
2. Governance votes to disable API access
3. Revert to manual processes (Phase 1) until issue resolved
4. Root cause analysis and security audit before re-enabling

---

**Comparison of Phases:**

| Aspect | Phase 1 (Manual) | Phase 2 (Semi-Auto) | Phase 3 (Full Auto) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Timeline** | 0-6 months | 6-12 months | 12+ months |
| **Fiat Accounts** | 1 (Operating only) | 2 (Treasury + Operating) | 2 (Treasury + Operating) |
| **Automation Level** | 0% | 50-70% | 90%+ |
| **Human Involvement** | High (every transaction) | Medium (routine only) | Low (compliance only) |
| **Infrastructure Cost** | $0 (manual) | $10k-20k (one-time dev) | $15k-25k (total) |
| **Transaction Speed** | 3-7 days (manual) | 1-3 days (automated) | <24 hours (automated) |
| **Security Risk** | Low (no API keys) | Medium (API secured by Threshold) | Medium (API secured by Threshold) |

---

**Record-Keeping (All Phases):**
- All crypto→fiat conversions logged on-chain (transaction hash)
- All fiat payments recorded with:
  - Date, amount, recipient, purpose, authorization (governance vote ID)
- Administrator provides quarterly financial statements
- Annual independent audit (if treasury >$500,000)

### 7.4 Reserves and Budgeting

**Reserve Policy:**
The Association shall maintain reserves sufficient for:

- **Operating Expenses**: 6-12 months of projected expenses (legal, accounting, hosting)
- **Emergency Fund**: $[10,000-50,000] for unexpected costs
- **Gas Fees**: Sufficient BNB for 100+ governance transactions

**Budget Approval:**
- Annual budget proposed and approved by governance vote
- Budget may be amended by governance vote at any time

### 7.5 Audits

**Financial Audits:**
- Annual review of fiat accounts by independent accountant (if budget >$[100,000])
- Public dashboard of crypto treasury (real-time via blockchain explorer)

**Smart Contract Audits:**
- Governor and Timelock contracts audited by reputable firm (e.g., CertiK, OpenZeppelin, Trail of Bits) before deployment
- Re-audit after any contract upgrade

---

## 9. REVENUE, COMPENSATION, AND VALUE EXTRACTION

### 9.1 Revenue Sources

The Association may generate revenue from:

- **Protocol Fees**: Transaction fees from ecosystem projects (e.g., Canton OTC, CantonFi)
- **Licensing**: Licensing proprietary technology to for-profit entities
- **Donations**: Crypto or fiat donations from supporters
- **Grants**: Grants from foundations, governments, or corporations
- **Services**: Consulting, development services, or training (if approved by governance)

**Important:** Revenue is **not** distributed to token holders as dividends. All revenue is reinvested in the mission or used for buyback & burn (see Section 9.5).

### 9.2 Reasonable Compensation

**Principle:**
The Association may pay "reasonable compensation" to members or third parties for services rendered, consistent with nonprofit law.

**Who May Be Compensated:**
- Researchers (via grants)
- Developers (for building ecosystem projects)
- Service providers (legal, accounting, hosting)
- Community members performing defined roles (e.g., community manager, security auditor)

**Approval Process:**
- All compensation packages >$[5,000] require governance vote
- Compensation must be benchmarked to market rates for similar roles

**Examples:**
- **Researcher Grant**: $30,000 for 6-month swarm intelligence research project
- **Lead Developer Salary**: $80,000/year for maintaining core smart contracts
- **Community Manager Stipend**: $2,000/month for Discord moderation and outreach

### 9.3 Prohibition on Profit Distribution

The Association **shall not**:

- Pay dividends to token holders
- Distribute profits based on token ownership
- Redeem tokens for cash (except via open market buyback)

This prohibition is essential to maintain nonprofit status and avoid securities law violations.

### 9.4 Conflict of Interest Disclosure

**Self-Dealing Transactions:**
When a token holder proposes a governance action that would benefit them financially (e.g., voting on their own grant or salary), they must:

1. **Disclose** the conflict of interest publicly before the vote
2. **Justify** that the compensation is reasonable and aligned with the mission
3. **Recuse** themselves from voting on the proposal (mandatory for all self-dealing transactions involving the proposer's direct financial benefit exceeding $5,000)

**Independent Review:**
For any self-dealing transaction exceeding $10,000, the Association shall seek independent review from at least two (2) disinterested token holders or an advisory committee to confirm that the compensation is reasonable and aligned with the Association's mission. This review shall be documented and published before the governance vote.

**Documentation:**
- All self-dealing transactions >$[10,000] must be documented with:
  - Explanation of necessity
  - Market rate comparison
  - Public comment period (e.g., 48 hours before vote)

**Penalties for Non-Disclosure:**
- Proposal invalidated
- Violator may be subject to governance-imposed penalties (e.g., loss of grant funding)

### 9.5 Buyback and Burn Mechanism

**Purpose:**
To support the long-term value of the GBR token, the Association may use a portion of protocol revenue to buy back GBR tokens from decentralized exchanges and permanently burn them.

**Legal Classification:**
- This is **not** a profit distribution to token holders
- This is an **asset management operation** to maintain protocol liquidity and stability
- Comparable to corporate stock buybacks (but without profit motive)

**Process:**
1. Governance proposes "Use $X from treasury to buy GBR on PancakeSwap"
2. Vote approves
3. Smart contract executes buyback via DEX aggregator
4. Purchased tokens sent to burn address (`0x000...000`)
5. Burn transaction publicly verifiable on-chain

**Frequency:**
- Quarterly or as determined by governance vote

**Limits:**
- Maximum [10-20%] of treasury balance per quarter (to avoid market manipulation)

**Reporting:**
- Monthly burn reports published on Association website and on-chain

### 9.6 Liquidity Provision

**Purpose:**
To ensure GBR token can be traded with minimal slippage, the Association acts as the **exclusive liquidity provider** on decentralized exchanges.

**DUNA as Sole LP Provider:**

The Association (through governance) is the **only entity providing base liquidity** for GBR token trading pairs:

- **Trading Pairs:** GBR/BNB (50% of liquidity) + GBR/USDT (50% of liquidity)
- **DEX:** PancakeSwap v2 on BNB Smart Chain (potential migration to v3 after 6-12 months via governance vote)
- **Locked Liquidity:** LP tokens locked via Team.Finance for 12 months (renewable by governance vote)
- **Initial Capital:** $50,000-100,000 from treasury (approved by governance vote)

**Mechanism:**
1. Governance approves depositing GBR + BNB/USDT into PancakeSwap v2 liquidity pools
2. Association receives LP tokens (CAKE-LP GBR-BNB and CAKE-LP GBR-USDT)
3. LP tokens immediately locked via Team.Finance for 12 months (public verification page)
4. Trading fees (0.25% on PancakeSwap v2) accrue to LP position → treasury revenue
5. All LP management (add/remove liquidity) requires governance vote

**Revenue from Liquidity:**
- All trading fees earned by LP positions accrue to the Association's treasury
- Used for operations, grants, buyback & burn, or reinvestment in ecosystem

**Rationale for Exclusive LP Model:**
- Full community control via governance over all liquidity
- Guaranteed market depth (not dependent on individual LPs)
- All trading fees benefit the Association's mission
- Transparency — all liquidity operations on-chain via Timelock

### 9.7 LP Burn Mechanism for Project Initialization

**INNOVATIVE GOVERNANCE MECHANISM (Contracts in testing):**

The Association recognizes a unique mechanism for community members to demonstrate **proof-of-commitment** when proposing high-value initiatives:

**LP Burn as Proposal Catalyst:**

Community members may **burn (permanently destroy) their own liquidity provider tokens** to gain special proposal rights, even if they do not meet the standard Proposal Threshold for GBR token holdings.

**How It Works:**

1. **Create LP Position:**
   - Community member deposits GBR + BNB/USDT into PancakeSwap
   - Receives LP tokens (CAKE-LP)

2. **Burn LP Tokens:**
   - Member sends LP tokens to Gybernaty LP Burn Contract (special smart contract)
   - LP tokens are **permanently burned** (irreversible)
   - Underlying liquidity remains in PancakeSwap pool forever (deepens market)

3. **Gain Proposal Rights:**
   - Member receives on-chain credential (NFT or token) proving LP burn
   - Credential grants right to submit **one high-priority governance proposal** for:
     * Research grant (e.g., $10k-$50k for swarm intelligence study)
     * Product development funding (e.g., new ecosystem project)
     * Critical governance decision (even if member lacks GBR for normal Proposal Threshold)

4. **Governance Vote:**
   - Community votes on proposal using standard process
   - If approved: Member receives requested funding or approval
   - If rejected: Member's burned LP is lost (but liquidity remains in pool, benefiting all)

**Rationale:**

- **Skin in the Game:** LP burn = irreversible financial commitment (member cannot reclaim burned value)
- **Dual Stake:** Member stakes both GBR and BNB/USDT (not just governance tokens)
- **Spam Prevention:** High cost (e.g., $1,000-$5,000 minimum burn) filters out frivolous proposals
- **Ecosystem Benefit:** Even failed proposals deepen liquidity permanently
- **Meritocracy:** Members with conviction can propose ambitious ideas without needing massive GBR holdings

**Example:**

Alice wants to research next-generation swarm coordination algorithms (estimated cost: $30,000).

- Alice holds only 0.3% of GBR supply (below 1% Proposal Threshold)
- Alice creates $5,000 LP position (GBR + BNB)
- Alice burns LP tokens via LP Burn Contract
- Alice receives credential to submit proposal
- Community votes: 78% approve (exceeds quorum and majority)
- Alice receives $30,000 grant from treasury
- Result: Alice conducts research, publishes findings, $5,000 permanently deepened liquidity

**Safeguards:**

- **Minimum Burn Amount:** Governance sets threshold (e.g., $1,000-$5,000) to prevent spam
- **Rate Limiting:** Maximum N LP burn proposals per month (e.g., 5-10) to prevent overload
- **Whitelist:** Members with proven track record (e.g., 2+ successful projects) may be exempt from LP burn requirement
- **Audit Requirement:** LP Burn Contract must be audited by reputable firm before deployment

**Legal Classification:**

- LP burn is a **voluntary community mechanism**, not a requirement for membership
- The Association does not solicit or encourage LP burning
- This mechanism is disclosed in this Agreement and on Association website
- No guarantees that burned LP will result in approved proposals
- Tax implications: Member should consult tax advisor (LP burn may be capital loss)

**Smart Contract Status:**

- Contracts developed and undergoing testing
- Will be deployed after security audit (CertiK, OpenZeppelin, or Trail of Bits)
- Contract addresses to be published on Association website and recorded in governance

**Governance Activation:**

- LP Burn Mechanism requires initial governance vote to activate
- Parameters (minimum burn, rate limits, etc.) set by governance and modifiable by future votes

- **Legal Mandate**: Court order or regulatory shutdown
- **Abandonment**: If no governance activity for >2 years and treasury <$1,000

### 13.2 Dissolution Process

**Step 1: Cease Operations**
- Halt all grants, contracts, and expenditures (except those necessary for winding down)
- Cancel services (hosting, subscriptions)
- Notify stakeholders (token holders, partners, regulators)

**Step 2: Settle Liabilities**

  - A charitable organization recognized under Section 501(c)(3)

**Designated Recipient:**
- If no specific recipient designated by dissolution vote, assets transfer to **[Ethereum Foundation, Internet Archive, or similar open-source/public-benefit organization]**

**Asset Distribution Priority:**
1. Pay debts and liabilities
2. Return restricted grants (if any donor restrictions require)
3. Remaining assets → Designated nonprofit recipient (approved by governance vote)

**Prohibition:**
